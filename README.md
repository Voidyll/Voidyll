- Hi, I’m @Voidyll
- My interests are website programming and game development. I'm very new to the programming work but hope to continue improving as I move into college and the professional world.
- I’m currently learning and experimenting with website development.
- I am most experienced with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C# and some Python.
